Recently I have been playing these games for different reazons.

Metal Gear Solid 3 is a game I enjoy to play once a year. I really think is a
great game with so much detail and love put into it. This game talks about
the conflict between U.S. and The Soviet Union during the cold war.
It's a game with an anti war theme.

Guilty Gear is a fighting game. There is not much to say other than I like the soundtrack.

Resident Evil 4 Remake, I could never finish this game back when I was 13. I guess I play
this remake because I just want to finish it at least once. But I also enjoy this version
and the older game too.

Xenoblade 3, is a JRPG. I enjoy the characters, the music and the story.
It has that anti war message just like MGS3.
